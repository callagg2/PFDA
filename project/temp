For this project, I'm going to look at the correlation between residential property prices and costs for building and construction materials.

https://data.gov.ie/dataset/hpm09-residential-property-price-index
https://data.gov.ie/dataset/wpm28-wholesale-price-index-excl-vat-for-building-and-construction-materials

I will use CSV files - the reason is that they are the simplest to work with

HPM09.20251124175125.csv - Residential_property_price_index
https://ws.cso.ie/public/api.restful/PxStat.Data.Cube_API.ReadDataset/HPM09/CSV/1.0/en
I've renamed it to - RPPI.csv



WPM28.20251124175238.csv - Wholesale Price Index (Excl VAT) for Building and Construction Materials 
https://ws.cso.ie/public/api.restful/PxStat.Data.Cube_API.ReadDataset/WPM28/CSV/1.0/en
I renamed it to - WPI_BCM.csv


Gathering the Data.
RPPI -
    - It has monthly data from February 2005 to Sept 2025, 
      but to be able to regress against WPI&BCM 
      I will run Sept 2014 to Sept 2014
    - I will remove all the months February 2005 to August 2014 (or not select to import them)

It also has many categories, so i will filter for National - all residential properties
I will be taking index data
I will also ignore all the data talking about the % Change over 12 months for Residential Property Price Index.

WPI-BCM
only goes up to 202409 from 201501
so will probably do Sept 14 to Sept 24

I will filter for the entry of Materials, ignoring the figures for every other category

Cleaning the Data
I will look use the ISNA function to check and replace that i have figures for every entry

Plotting the data, line charts, or indeed regression, 
this should show the posiitve relationship between both sets of data.
Explain, how i could not just pick out any one material because i don't know the proportion that goes into the house, though I could guess.

Investigate - there might be a way of seeing if there is a lagging trend.
Time series data, so need to get the axis working correctly.
